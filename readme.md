# Keys

Configs for setting up machines. Arch and Ubuntu are usually for virtual machines that I can set up a fresh instance with everything I need for malware analysis on.

MacOS contains my Dotfiles and rices. üêà

## Contents

### Arch Linux
  
- Setup script that installs most of the things I need for VMs.

### Ubuntu

- Setup script that installs most of the things I need for VMs.

### MacOS

A setup that works nearly straight out of the box with a one command install with `./macbook.sh`.

### MacOS Rice Versions

I update the master branch to my latest rice and configs. If you want to use a previous version, I reccommend going back into the commit history and viewing the repo at the time of the version you want.

### v2 - Rose Pine

This is my most current rice which will be updated as I get going on it.

Sketchybar config inspired by this [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1hr894j/yabai_2025_rice_gruvbox_light/) post.

- More "consistent" Rose Pine theming.
- Sketchybar config and widgets updated.
- Dotfiles for zsh, yabai, and skhd improved or updated.
